# White Noise - Random Walk
# ==========================
# Pattern: Pure random walk with no predictable pattern
# Use: Testing that agent doesn't learn spurious patterns

data_generator:
  pattern_type: "upward_drift"  # Using drift generator with zero drift
  n_samples: 500
  base_price: 50000.0
  drift_rate: 0.0  # No drift - pure white noise
  volatility: 0.001  # Higher volatility for random walk effect
  pullback_floor: 0.98  # Allow more variation
  start_date: "2024-01-01"

  # Expected behavior:
  # - No consistent strategy should work
  # - Agent should learn to stay neutral/minimize trading
