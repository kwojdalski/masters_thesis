## Design of the research

The whole system can be divided into three main parts:

* Data preprocessing - taking FX data from Bloomberg with use of the dedicated API, parsing the data and adjusting
 it for the further analysis. The system is dedicated for currency trading, however with little adjustments
 it could fit in other asset classes as well.
 * Variable extraction - not all preprocessed currency pairs are relevant and worth adding. For instance, 
 if $USD/CNH$ is highly correlated with $USD/CNY$ it is senseless to add the latter to the portfolio.
 #TO DO
* State-action space - the extracted variables, based on time series for currency pairs, are merged into state space.
