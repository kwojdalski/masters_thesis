# Research Objective

The primary research goal was to evaluate the Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm for multiasset trading.
The main idea behind the algorithm deployment is that it can systematically outperform benchmarks 
in terms of selected risk and return measures. 
Designed trading system was aimed to spot non-trivial patterns in data, more efficiently than human, and exploit them accordingly.

In the project author wanted to assess the possibility of using a reinforcement learning agent for trading domain. The objectives are as follows

* Implementation - consisting of creating reinforcement learning-based agent that are capable of trading financial instruments 
basing on time series tables
* Evaluation - testing if trading agents for out-of-sample periods can outperform benchmarks in the measures provided by the author
* Conclusion - answering the question if such approach might help in generating abnormal positive results and determining if the method can 
be feasible and efficient in real-like environment
