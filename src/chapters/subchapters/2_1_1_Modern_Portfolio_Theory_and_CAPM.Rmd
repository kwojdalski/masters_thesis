The following chapter introduces articles that correspond with the subject of the current thesis and are considered as fundamentals of modern finance.
Specifically, the beginning contains financial market models. The next subchapter includes basic investment effectiveness indicators that implicitly or explicitly result from the fundamental formulas from the first subchapter.

## Selected financial market models and theory


Works considered as a fundament of quantitative finance and investments are @Sharpe1964, @Lintner1965, and @Mossin1966. All these authors, almost simultaneously, formulated Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) that describes dependability between rate of return and its risk, risk of the market portfolio, and risk premium.
Assumptions in the model are as follows:

* Decisions in the model regard only one period,
* Market participants has risk aversion, i.e. their utility function is related with plus sign to rate of return, and negatively to variance of portfolio rate of return,
* Risk-free rate exists,
* Asymmetry of information non-existent,
* Lack of speculative transactions,
* Lack of transactional costs, taxes included,
* Market participants can buy a fraction of the asset,
* Both sides are price takers,
* Short selling exists,

Described by the following model formula is as follows:
$$
E(R_P)=R_F+\frac{\sigma_P}{\sigma_M}\times[E(R_M)-R_F]
$$
where:

* $E(R_P)$ -- the expected portfolio rate of return,
* $E(R_M)$ -- the expected market rate of return,
* $R_F$ -- risk-free rate,
* $\sigma_P$ -- the standard deviation of the rate of return on the portfolio,
* $\sigma_M$ -- the standard deviation of the rate of return on the market portfolio.

$E(R_P)$ function is also known as Capital Market Line (CML). Any portfolio lies on that line is effective, i.e. its rate of return corresponds to embedded risk.
The next formula includes all portfolios, single assets included. It is also known as Security Market Line (SML) and is given by the following equation:
$$ \label{eq:erl}
E(R_i)=R_F+\beta_i\times[E(R_M)-R_F]
$$
where:

* $E(R_i)$ -- the expected $i$-th portfolio rate of return,
* $E(R_M)$ -- the expected market rate of return,
* $R_F$ -- risk-free rate,
* $\beta_i$ -- Beta factor of the $i$-th portfolio.


## The Modern Portfolio Theory
The following section discuss the Modern Portfolio Theory developed by Henry Markowitz @Markowitz1952. The author introduced the model in which the goal
(investment criteria) is 
not only to maximize the return but also to minimize the variance. He claimed that by combining assets in different composition it is possible to obtain the 
portfolios with the same return but different levels of risk. The risk reduction is possible by diversification, i.e. giving proper weights for each asset 
in the portfolio. Variance of portfolio value can be effectively reduced by analyzing mutual relations between returns on assets with use of methods in statistics
(correlation and covariance matrices). It is important to say that any additional asset in portfolio reduces minimal variance for a given portfolio 
but it is the correlation what really impacts the magnitude.
The Markowitz theory implies that for any assumed expected return there is the only one portfolio that minimizes risk. Alternatively, there is only one portfolio 
that maximizes return for the assumed risk level. The important term, which is brought in literature, is the effective portfolio, i.e. the one that meets conditions
above.

![Efficient Frontier](../img/markowitz_frontier.jpg)

The Markowitz concept is determined by the assumption that investors are risk-averse. This observation is described by the following formula:

$$
E(U)<U(E(X))
$$
where:

* $E(U)$ -- the expected value of utility from payoff;
* $U(E(X))$ -- utility of the expected value of payoff.

The expected value of payoff is given by the following formula:
$$
E(U)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\pi_iU(c_i)
$$
where:

* $\pi_i$ -- probability of the $c_i$ payoff,
* $U(c_i)$ -- utility from the $c_i$ payoff.

One of the MPT biggest flaws is the fact that it is used for ex post analysis. Correlation between assets changes overtime so results must be recalculated. Real portfolio risk may be underestimated. Also, time window can influence the results.

## Efficient Market Hypothesis

In 1965, Eugene Fama introduced the efficient market term. Fama claimed that an efficient market is the one that instanteneously discounts the new information arrival in market price of a given asset. Because this definition applies to financial markets, it determined the further belief that it is not possible to beat the market because assets are correctly priced. Also, if this hypothesis would be true, market participants cannot be better or worse. Their portfolio return would be a function of new, unpredictable information. In that respect, the only role of an investor is to manage his assets so that the risk is acceptable. @Fama1965

It is highly unlikely that EMH exists in its strongest form due to successful quantitative hedge funds that consistetly beat the markets. For instance, Renaissance Capital hedge fund generated on average 40% per annum in the last 30 years @Shen2017.

Formally, Efficient Market Hypothesis states that a market is efficient with respect to information set $F_t$ if its impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of that information set. In other words, it is not possible to achieve any better than risk-adjusted average rate of return. In its essence that claim is consistent with classical price theory @Weber2012. Over time, other versions (forms) of the EMH has been introduced - weak, semi-strong, and strong @Fama1970.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Weak Form of the EMH}
$F_t$ represents only the information contained in the past price history of the market as of time $t$
\end{definition}

What means that there is not possibility to make abnormal returns by using the past price movements and volumes to predict the future price movements. However, fundamental analysis might be used to generate such results because the market is not perfect in spotting undervalued and overvalued stocks. Hence, the participants can find profitable companies by researching their financial statements.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Semi-Strong Form of the EMH}
$F_t$ represents all information publicly available at time $t$
\end{definition}

It states that neither technical, nor fundamental analysis cannot be exploited for gaining superior returns, and only non-public material information might help in above average results.

\theoremstyle{definition}
\begin{definition}{Strong Form of the EMH}
$F_t$ represents all information (public and private) known to anyone at time t.
\end{definition}

The strong form rejects the idea of any possibility to consistently beating the market. According to this idea, any kind information, public or non-public, is completely embedded into current financial asset prices. In other words, there is no advantage for anyone in the market. Returns that deviate from expected values are attributed to pure randomness.

## Critic of strong form of the EMH

There are at least a few documented anomalies that contradicts with efficient market hypothesis. For example, price/earnings (P/E) measure can help in systematically outperforming stocks @Malkiel2003.
The neglected firm effect claims that "uninteresting" companies, often ignored by market analysts are sometimes incorrectly priced, and offer investors potentially fruitful opportunities. Another phenomenon that cannot be explained by the strong form of EMH is so called the January effect @Haug2006.  According to the authors of "The January Effect" working paper, returns reached in January has predictive power for the upcoming 11 months. It persists for both small and large cap companies.

Although the strongest form in its essence is justified, logically correct, it is rather unlikely that it explains the reality, even due to the effects mentioned above.
