Con- sumers base their fund purchase decisions on prior performance information, but do so asymmetrically, investing disproportionately more in funds that performed very well the prior period. Search costs seem to be an important determinant of fund flows. High performance appears to be most salient for funds that exert higher marketing effort, as measured by higher fees. Flows are directly related to the size of the fund's complex as well as the current media attention received by the fund, which lower consumers' search costs},

Most important among those lessons is order flow's ability to account for the lion's share of movements in the major floating rates. On the policy front, widespread availability of electronic order-flow data brings many policy questions within our reach for the first time. Af- ter reviewing these policy questions, the article closes with a dis- cussion of how FX market institutions are evolving and how this evolution will affect application of order-flow analysis in the future},

We show that the the long-short strategy learned for a synthetic asset, whose price follows a stochastic process with some exploitable patterns, consistently outperforms the market. RL thus shows the potential to deal with many financial problems, that can be often formulated as sequential decision problems.},

Within the last few years considerable progress has been made in three closely related areas the theory of portfolio selection, the theory of the pricing of capital assets under conditions of risk, and the general behavior of stock-market prices. Results obtained in all three areas are relevant for evaluating mutual fund performance. Unfortunately, few of the studies of mutual funds have taken advantage of the substantial backlog of theoretical and empirical material made available by recent studies in these related areas. Drawing on results obtained in the field of portfolio analysis, economist Jack L. Treynor has suggested a new predictor of mutual fund performance, one that differs from virtually all those used previously by incorporating the volatiity of a fund's return in a simple yet meaningful manner. This paper attempts to extend Treynor's work by subjecting his proposed measure to empirical test in order to evaluate its predictive ability.},

	abstract = {We propose to train trading systems by optimizing fi-nancial objective functions via reinforcement learning. The performance functions that we consider as value functions are profit or wealth, the Sharpe ratio and our recently proposed differential Sharpe ratio for on-line learning. In Moody \& Wu (1997), we presented empirical results in controlled experiments that demon-strated the advantages of reinforcement learning rela-tive to supervised learning. Here we extend our pre-vious work to compare Q-Learning to a reinforcement learning technique based on real-time recurrent learn-ing (RTRL) that maximizes immediate reward. Our simulation results include a spectacular demon-stration of the presence of predictability in the monthly Standard and Poors 500 stock index for the 25 year period 1970 through 1994. Our reinforcement trader achieves a simulated out-of-sample profit of over 4000\% for this period, compared to the return for a buy and hold strategy of about 1300\% (with dividends rein-vested). This superior result is achieved with substan-tially lower risk. Introduction: Reinforcement Learning for Trading The investor's or trader's ultimate goal is to optimize some relevant measure of trading system performance, such as profit, economic utility or risk-adjusted return. In this paper, we propose to use reinforcement learn-ing to directly optimize such trading system perfor-mance functions, and we compare two different rein-forcement learning methods. The first uses immediate rewards to train the trading systems, while the sec-ond (Q-Learning (Watkins)) approximates discounted future rewards. These methodologies can be applied to optimizing systems designed to trade a single secu-rity or to trade a portfolio of securities. In addition, we propose a novel value function for risk adjusted re-turn suitable for online learning: the differential Sharpe ratio.},

This paper presents a financial-model-free Reinforcement Learning framework to provide a deep machine learning solution to the portfolio management problem.

This framework is realized in three instants in this work with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a basic Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). They are, along with a number of recently reviewed or published portfolio-selection strategies, examined in three back-test experiments with a trading period of 30 minutes in a cryptocurrency market. Cryptocurrencies are electronic and decentralized alternatives to government-issued money, with Bitcoin as the best-known example of a cryptocurrency. All three instances of the framework monopolize the top three positions in all experiments, outdistancing other compared trading algorithms. Although with a high commission rate of 0.25\% in the backtests, the framework is able to achieve at least 4-fold returns in 50 days.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses the theory of random-walk model and then tests the model's empirical validity. The main conclusion will be that the data seem to present consistent and strong support for the model. This implies, of course, that chart reading, though perhaps an interesting pastime, is of no real value to the stock market investor. This is an extreme statement and the chart reader is certainly free to take exception. Since the empirical evidence produced by this and other studies in support of the random-walk model is now so voluminous, the counterarguments of the chart reader will be completely lacking in force if they are not equally well supported by empirical work. By contrast the stock market trader has a much more practical criterion for judging what constitutes important dependence in successive price changes. For his purposes the random walk model is valid as long, as knowledge of the past behavior of the series of price changes cannot be used to increase expected gains. More specifically, the independence assumption is an adequate description of reality as long as the actual degree of dependence in the series of price changes is not sufficient to allow the past history of the series to be used to predict the future in a way, which makes expected profits greater than they would be under a naive buy-and-hold model.},

	doi = {10.1515/humr.2003.021},
	abstract = {This graduate text provides an intuitive but rigorous treatment of contemporary methods used in microeconometric research. The book makes clear that applied microeconometrics is about the estimation of marginal and treatment effects, and that parametric estimation is simply a means to this end. It also clarifies the distinction between causality and statistical association.The book focuses specifically on cross section and panel data methods. Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods. The numerous end-of-chapter problems are an important component of the book. Some problems contain important points not fully described in the text, and others cover new ideas that can be analyzed using tools presented in the current and previous chapters. Several problems require the use of the data sets located at the author's website.},

Further-more, it can learn to do this in a remarkably short period of time (8 or 10 hours of machine-playing time) when given only the rules of the game, a sense of direction, and a redundant and incomplete list of parameters which are thought to have something to do with the game, but whose correct signs and relative weights are unknown and unspecified.
