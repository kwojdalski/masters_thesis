\begin{abstract}

This thesis examines the application of reinforcement learning techniques to
foreign exchange market trading strategies. The investigation commences with a
comprehensive analysis of the FX market structure, including its organizational
framework, key participants, and recent evolutionary developments. The author
provides a critical assessment of prevailing trends and potential future
trajectories in this domain.

The subsequent section establishes the theoretical foundation for the research,
presenting a detailed exposition of relevant financial models and artificial
intelligence methodologies that underpin the analytical framework.

The empirical component in the third chapter implements a Q-learning based
reinforcement learning approach, yielding inconclusive results that warrant
further investigation.
