# Introduction

The conventional representation of trading floors as chaotic environments
characterized by vocal trader interactions was historically accurate approximately
three decades ago. However, the financial industry has since undergone substantial
structural transformation.

The financial sector has consistently functioned as an early adopter of
computational innovations. This technological integration represents a strategic
imperative—competitive advantage through advanced technological implementation
frequently correlates with enhanced financial performance metrics. The industry
has systematically pioneered the deployment of state-of-the-art technologies,
ranging from sophisticated Bloomberg terminal infrastructure in the 1990s to
contemporary blockchain applications and ultra-low latency systems, all oriented
toward maximizing operational efficiency[^1].

[^1]: The banking sector is frequently identified in empirical literature as a
primary industry implementing blockchain technology.

Trading entities, functioning as utility-maximizing economic agents, fundamentally
aim to optimize market-derived profits. Multiple methodological approaches exist
to achieve this objective, with varying degrees of complexity. Notably, Warren
Buffett, a statistically significant outlier in investment performance metrics,
continues to employ a passive buy-and-hold strategy.

In recent years, methodologies predicated on artificial intelligence and machine
learning algorithms have demonstrated increasing significance. This phenomenon
correlates with advancements in computational processing capacity, decreasing
infrastructure expenditure requirements, and empirical recognition of cognitive
biases in human decision-making processes @Arnold2017. A growing consensus within
the literature suggests that algorithmic systems should supplement or potentially
supersede human involvement in decision-making and execution processes @Turner2015.
The progressive automation of trading activities will likely continue its
trajectory in subsequent temporal periods, contradicting the aforementioned
stereotypical trading floor representation.

Although machine learning's theoretical foundations date to the 1950s, its
explicit implementation in trading contexts remains relatively limited. For
example, in institutional foreign exchange trading, only entities with substantial
capital resources and sophisticated quantitative infrastructure have developed
effective machine learning trading systems @Mosic2017.

This research investigates potential applications of machine learning—specifically
reinforcement learning methodologies—in developing trading systems capable of
generating statistically significant positive outcomes.

Currently, most systems documented in academic literature aim to maximize either
absolute trading profits or risk-adjusted performance metrics. Despite numerous
methodological approaches to create consistently profitable systems utilizing
variables derived from financial econometrics, fundamental analysis, or machine
learning algorithms, many have demonstrated suboptimal performance due to several
factors, including:

* Frequent large drawdowns resulting in excessive performance volatility
* Prohibitive transaction costs rendering strategies economically unfeasible
* Excessive computational complexity, particularly problematic for high-frequency
  trading implementations

Even when empirical research demonstrates exceptional results, upon publication,
any competitive advantage tends to diminish through market efficiency mechanisms.
Strategies with persistent alpha-generating capabilities must remain proprietary
to maintain their effectiveness.

#### Work Structure

This thesis is structured to provide a comprehensive analytical framework for
understanding reinforcement learning algorithms applied to trading contexts.

The first section provides a detailed examination of the intersection between
artificial intelligence methodologies and financial markets, exploring the
historical relationship between quantitative finance and computational science.

The second chapter presents a systematic review of selected literature from
quantitative finance, examining both classical equilibrium models such as CAPM
(the established paradigm in equity research) and contemporary approaches. This
section evaluates the implicit advantages and limitations of various financial
models, with particular emphasis on algorithmic trading methodologies employed in
comparable research contexts.

The third section analyzes machine learning frameworks, providing a theoretical
basis for why reinforcement learning may represent an optimal approach for certain
trading applications. It presents a taxonomic comparison of major machine learning
categories to elucidate their methodological distinctions, introduces key
reinforcement learning concepts with illustrative examples, and addresses potential
limitations and implementation challenges associated with these algorithms.

The fourth part details the experimental methodology, including research
objectives, data characteristics, experimental design parameters, and empirical
results. The primary objective was to develop trading agents capable of
statistically outperforming established benchmarks on risk-adjusted performance
measures in the foreign exchange market—agents characterized by statistical
robustness, adaptive learning capability, and consistent performance metrics. This
chapter presents the mathematical formulations and procedural implementations
leading to the empirical results, examining each component of the trading system.

The implemented algorithms utilize a dynamic optimization approach. Beyond a value
function based on Differential Sharpe Ratio, the system incorporates various
technical indicators such as Relative Strength Index to inform algorithmic
decision-making processes. The methodology incorporates transaction cost models to
simulate realistic trading conditions.

The value function integrates multiple statistical measures, including Sharpe and
Differential Sharpe Ratios, to capture both risk and return dimensions. The
algorithm outputs agent actions in the discrete action space {-1,0,1}. The final
section of this chapter evaluates the reinforcement learning-based trading system
against two benchmark methodologies:

* A buy-and-hold strategy (maintaining consistent long positions in selected
  currency pairs)
* Random action generation—producing stochastic values in the domain of {-1,0,1}
  to determine positions in underlying pairs. This benchmark excludes transaction
  costs, as such a strategy would incur prohibitive cumulative costs with position
  changes occurring in approximately two-thirds of states.

The concluding section presents a comparative analysis with similar research and
proposes directions for future investigation, addressing research questions such
as:

* What additional implementations could enhance performance metrics?
* What methodological limitations were encountered and how might they be addressed
  in subsequent research?
