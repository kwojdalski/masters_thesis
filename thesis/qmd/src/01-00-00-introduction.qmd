# Introduction

The conventional representation of trading floors as chaotic environments
characterized by vocal trader interactions was historically accurate in the 1980s.
However, the financial industry has since undergone substantial
structural transformation.

The financial sector has consistently functioned as an early adopter of
computational innovations. This integration represents a strategic
imperative—competitive advantage through technology frequently correlates with financial performance.
Hence, the industry has systematically pioneered the deployment of
state-of-the-art technologies,
ranging from sophisticated Bloomberg terminal infrastructure in the 1990s to
contemporary blockchain applications and ultra-low latency systems, all oriented
toward maximizing operational efficiency.

primary industry implementing blockchain technology.

Trading entities, functioning as economic agents,
aim to optimize market-derived profits. Multiple methodological approaches exist
to achieve this objective. Various approaches exist across the investment
spectrum: value investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett employ
fundamental analysis with long-term horizons; quantitative firms such as
Two Sigma utilize computational methods for systematic trading; while
high-frequency trading entities like Citadel Securities implement
ultra-low latency strategies to capitalize on microscopic price discrepancies.

In recent years, methodologies predicated on artificial intelligence and machine
learning algorithms have demonstrated increasing significance. This phenomenon
correlates with computational processing capacity, decreasing
infrastructure expenditure requirements, and empirical recognition of cognitive
biases in human decision-making processes. A growing consensus within
the literature suggests that algorithmic systems should supplement or potentially
supersede human involvement in decision-making and execution processes @Turner2015.
The progressive automation of trading activities will likely continue its
direction, contradicting the stereotypical trading floor representation.

Although machine learning's theoretical foundations date to the 1950s, its
explicit implementation in trading contexts remains relatively limited. For
example, in institutional foreign exchange trading, only entities with substantial
capital resources and sophisticated quantitative infrastructure have developed
effective machine learning trading systems @Mosic2017.

This research investigates potential applications of machine learning—specifically
reinforcement learning methodologies—in developing trading systems capable of
generating statistically significant positive outcomes.

Currently, most systems documented in academic literature aim to maximize either
absolute trading profits or risk-adjusted performance metrics. Despite numerous
methodological approaches to create consistently profitable systems utilizing
variables derived from financial econometrics, fundamental analysis, or machine
learning algorithms, many have demonstrated suboptimal performance due to several
factors, including:

* Large drawdowns resulting in excessive performance volatility
* High transaction costs rendering strategies impractical
* High computational complexity, particularly problematic for high-frequency
  trading

Even when empirical research demonstrates exceptional results, upon publication,
any competitive advantage tends to diminish through market efficiency mechanisms.
Strategies with persistent alpha-generating capabilities must remain proprietary
to maintain their effectiveness.
