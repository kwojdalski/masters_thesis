#### Direct Optimization of Performance

In this modern approach, there is no intermediate step and labeled data is not
given. The environment is observed, $X_t$, the system carries out an action, and
receives a scalar reward for its past activities, representing the trading
performance in some form (e.g. rate of return). Based on this reward, the system
alters the way it behaves in subsequent episodes and steps.
