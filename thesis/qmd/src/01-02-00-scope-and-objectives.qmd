## Scope and Objectives of the Research

### Hypothesis

The research is based on the following hypotheses:

1. AI-driven algorithms can deliver superior value by exceeding benchmark performance metrics in terms of both risk management and return generation
2. Enhanced performance is particularly evident in high-frequency trading scenarios as well as across extended time horizons
3. These algorithms demonstrate the capability to implicitly learn market patterns that would be impossible for humans to identify and efficiently select securities. In consequence, they generate alpha

### Objectives of the Research

The primary research goal is to evaluate Reinforcement Learning-based
algorithms for multiasset trading, with particular focus on pair trading
strategies. The research objectives are structured in three interconnected
phases:

1. **Design and Implementation**
   - Develop both basic and extended Reinforcement Learning trading agents
     for pair trading applications
   - Construct robust testing frameworks to evaluate agent performance
   - Create agents capable of processing financial time series data

2. **Testing and Evaluation**
   - Assess agent performance on out-of-sample data against established
     benchmarks
   - Measure performance using comprehensive risk-return metrics
   - Analyze robustness under varying market conditions
   - Determine if agents can outperform conventional trading approaches

3. **Analysis and Implications**
   - Examine agent learning evolution and pattern recognition capabilities
   - Investigate how agents integrate with traditional pair trading
     methodologies
   - Assess transaction cost management effectiveness
   - Determine if agents can identify non-trivial patterns more efficiently
     than human traders
   - Evaluate the feasibility of deployment in real-world trading
     environments
   - Identify promising directions for future research

The underlying premise is that these algorithms can systematically outperform
benchmarks by detecting and exploiting market patterns that would remain
imperceptible to human traders, potentially generating alpha in both
high-frequency trading environment.
