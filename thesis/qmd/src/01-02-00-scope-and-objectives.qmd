## Scope and Objectives of the Research

### Hypothesis

The research is based on the following hypotheses:

1. AI-driven algorithms can deliver superior value by exceeding benchmark performance metrics in terms of both risk management and return generation
2. Enhanced performance is particularly evident in high-frequency trading scenarios as well as across extended time horizons
3. These algorithms demonstrate the capability to implicitly learn market patterns that would be impossible for humans to identify and efficiently select securities. In consequence, they generate alpha

### Objectives of the Research

The research has three main objectives:

1. **Design and Implementation**
   - Design and implement a basic and an extended Reinforcement Learning trading agent for pair trading
   - Develop robust testing frameworks for both approaches

2. **Testing and Comparison**
   - Test and compare both approaches on out-of-sample test data
   - Evaluate performance using selected performance measures
   - Analyze the robustness of the approaches under different market conditions

3. **Interpretation and Implications**
   - Analyze how the agents evolve their learning processes
   - Study how their developed policies integrate conventional pair trading approaches
   - Investigate transaction cost management strategies
   - Identify and suggest potential avenues for future research
