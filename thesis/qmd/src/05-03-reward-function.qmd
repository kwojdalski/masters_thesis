## Reward Function
### Differential Sharpe Ratio


Differential Sharpe Ratio (DSR) is a dynamic extension of the Sharpe ratio.
This measure captures the marginal impact of returns at time $t$ on the Sharpe
Ratio. The calculation begins with the following formulations:
$$
A_n=\frac{1}{n}R_n+\frac{n-1}{n}A_{n-1}
$$
$$
B_n=\frac{1}{n}R_n^2+\frac{n-1}{n}B_{n-1}
$$
At $t=0$, both values equal zero. These serve as the foundation for calculating
the exponentially moving Sharpe ratio on an $\eta$ time scale:
$$
S_t=\frac{A_t}{K_\eta\sqrt{B_t-A_t^2}}
$$
where:

* $A_t=\eta R_t+(1-\eta)A_{t_1}$
* $B_t=\eta R_t^2+(1-\eta)B_{t_1}$
* $K_\eta=(\frac{1-\frac{\eta}{2}}{1-\eta})$

The differential Sharpe ratio offers several advantages in algorithmic systems
(Moody & Wu, 1997):

* Recursive updating - eliminating the need to recalculate mean and standard
  deviation of returns each time. The formulations for $A_t$ and $B_t$ allow
  simple calculation through updates for $R_t$ and $R_t^2$.
* Efficient on-line optimization - the formula structure enables quick
  computation through updates of the most recent values.
* Interpretability - the measure is easily explained, as it quantifies how the
  latest return affects the Sharpe ratio (risk and reward).
