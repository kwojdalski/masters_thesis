## Trading based on Forecasts

In such a system forecast is optimized to produce price forecasts from a set of
inputs. Supervised learning techniques are used, basing on statistics such as
mean squared error.
Minimizing an error is only an intermediate step - the outcome of Forecasting
System is then used for buying or selling decisions for analyzed asset(s) inside
Trading Rules. Then the latter module is subject to evaluation module
(Profits/Losses $U(\theta, \theta^{'})$) which consts of some financial measure.
It must be noted that Forecasting module outputs only that predicted price while
leaving the original inputs. It can be inefficient since Trading Rules sometimes
might need more than just price. [^1]

when an asset price spiked in relation to its normal jumps.
