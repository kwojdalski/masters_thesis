## Trading based on Forecasts

Forecast-based trading systems employ supervised learning techniques to generate
price predictions from a set of input variables. These systems optimize for
statistical accuracy metrics such as mean squared error during the training
phase.

The forecasting process represents merely an intermediate step in the trading
workflow. The predicted prices generated by the Forecasting System subsequently
inform trading decisions within the Trading Rules module. Performance evaluation
occurs through financial metrics in the Profits/Losses evaluation module
$U(\theta, \theta^{'})$. A significant limitation of this approach is that the
Forecasting module typically outputs only the predicted price while discarding
potentially valuable contextual information from the original inputs.
This exemplifies a fundamental limitation in forecast-based trading systems:
the information loss problem. When a system predicts that MSFT will reach $300
tomorrow based solely on technical indicators, it discards critical contextual
variables such as abnormal trading volume and volatility patterns. The formal
representation of this problem can be expressed as:

$$f: X \rightarrow \hat{y}$$

where:
- $X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the input space
- $\hat{y} \in \mathbb{R}$ represents the scalar price prediction

The dimensionality reduction from $\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\mathbb{R}$ results in
significant information loss that may be crucial for optimal trading
decisions.[^1]

[^1]: The information loss can be quantified through mutual information:
$I(X;\hat{y}) < I(X;X)$, indicating that the prediction $\hat{y}$ contains
less information about market conditions than the original feature set $X$.
