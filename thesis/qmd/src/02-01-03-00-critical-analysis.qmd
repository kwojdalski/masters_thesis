## Critical Analysis of Traditional Financial Models

### Criticism of the Efficient Market Hypothesis and Modern Portfolio Theory

The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that investors cannot earn excess
returns on a risk-adjusted basis. Complementarily, Markowitz's Modern Portfolio
Theory (MPT) provides a framework for constructing portfolios that optimize
risk-return profiles based on available investment options.

If markets are truly efficient as EMH suggests, portfolios constructed using the
Markowitz framework would not generate excess returns. However, if market
inefficiencies exist, these portfolios could potentially earn returns exceeding
market benchmarks. Notably, MPT allows investors to incorporate subjective
views regarding expected asset returns, contributing to its widespread
applicability and Markowitz's Nobel Prize recognition.

Both theories gained popularity synergistically and share similar criticisms.
Despite MPT becoming an industry standard, it faces several significant
limitations:

1. **Problematic Risk Measurement**: MPT treats upside and downside price
   movements equally in risk calculations. It also assumes constant volatility,
   whereas real-world markets demonstrate volatility clustering across various
   time horizons.

2. **Simplified Cash Flow Assumptions**: The model ignores transaction costs and
   tax implications. It also fails to account for investor preferences regarding
   dividend income.

3. **Unrealistic Liquidity Assumptions**: MPT assumes investors can take
   arbitrarily large positions at current market prices without affecting those
   prices, contradicting market impact realities.

4. **Idealized Investor Behavior**: The theory presumes all market participants
   are rational, risk-averse, and share identical investment time horizons.
