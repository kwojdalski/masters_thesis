### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning (RL) represents a distinct paradigm in machine learning
where an agent learns optimal behaviors through trial-and-error interactions
with an environment. The agent perceives the environment's state as a feature
vector, executes actions, and receives rewards that may lead to new states.

The fundamental objective in RL is to develop a policyâ€”a function mapping
states to actions that maximizes expected cumulative rewards over time. This
approach differs significantly from both supervised and unsupervised learning
paradigms.

Key characteristics of reinforcement learning include:

- **Sequential Decision Making**: RL addresses problems where decisions occur in
  sequence and have long-term implications.

- **Delayed Rewards**: Actions may not yield immediate benefits but contribute
  to greater cumulative rewards in the future.

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Agents must balance discovering new
  potentially better strategies against utilizing known rewarding actions.

RL is particularly well-suited for non-stationary environments where
relationships between variables evolve over time. The agent continuously adapts
its policy to changing conditions, making it useful for applications where
 dynamics constantly shift.

This interdisciplinary field incorporates influences from engineering,
economics, mathematics, neuroscience, psychology, and computer science.
Applications span diverse domains including game playing, robotics, resource
management, logistics, and, increasingly, financial trading strategies.

Unlike supervised learning, RL does not rely on labeled examples that specify
exactly what an algorithm should do. Instead, the agent must learn from its own
actions, sense states, and accumulate experience. The only feedback received is
a scalar reward signal.

While unsupervised learning focuses on identifying structures in unlabeled
datasets, RL specifically aims to maximize a long-run value function comprising
summed (discounted) rewards. Finding data patterns may be useful, but it
addresses a fundamentally different objective than the RL problem.

The environment changes stochastically and interacts with the agent, requiring
a policy design that balances exploration of new actions against exploitation
of known solutions. This prevents purely greedy behavior that might lead to
suboptimal outcomes.
