# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning represents a distinct paradigm in machine learning where
an agent interacts with an environment, learning optimal behaviors through
trial and error. In this framework, the agent perceives the environment's state
as a feature vector and can execute actions in each state. These actions yield
varying rewards and potentially transition the agent to new states.

The fundamental objective in reinforcement learning is to develop a policyâ€”a
function that maps states to actions. Formally, this policy function f (analogous
to supervised learning models) takes a state's feature vector as input and
outputs the optimal action for that state. An action is considered optimal when
it maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

Key characteristics of reinforcement learning include:

- **Sequential Decision Making**: Unlike other learning paradigms, reinforcement
  learning addresses problems where decisions occur in sequence and have
  long-term implications.

- **Delayed Rewards**: The agent must learn to take actions that may not
  immediately yield rewards but contribute to greater cumulative rewards in
  the future.

- **Exploration vs. Exploitation**: Agents must balance exploring new actions
  to discover potentially better strategies against exploiting known
  rewarding actions.

Reinforcement learning is particularly well-suited for non-stationary
environments where relationships between variables evolve over time. In these
contexts, the agent continuously adapts its policy to changing conditions,
making it valuable for financial applications where market dynamics constantly
shift.

Applications of reinforcement learning span diverse domains including game
playing, robotics, resource management, logistics, and increasingly, financial
trading strategies such as statistical arbitrage. The target variable in
reinforcement learning can be viewed as a specialized output designed to solve
specific optimization problems within dynamic environments.

This type of Machine Learning is discussed in detail in the following section.
