In this chapter, the term **machine learning** and its subfields are explained.
The discussion also encompasses potential applications for trading financial
instruments.

As the field evolves, numerous definitions of machine learning emerge from
various sources. In this subchapter, the author has selected definitions that
accurately capture the essence of the discipline.

What is machine learning? The most widely accepted definitions are as follows:

* "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel, a pioneer in machine learning and
computer gaming @Samuel1959
* "A computer program is said to learn from experience $E$ with respect to some
class of tasks $T$ and performance measure $P$, if its performance at tasks in
$T$, as measured by $P$, improves with experience $E$." - Tom Mitchell, a
computer scientist and E. Fredkin University Professor at Carnegie Mellon
University (CMU) @Mitchell1997

The latter is particularly regarded as an elegant and modern definition. Less
formal, but equally relevant observations come from textbook authors in the
discipline:

* "Pattern recognition has its origins in engineering, whereas machine learning
grew out of computer science. However, these activities can be viewed as two
facets of the same field…" - Christopher Bishop
* "One of the most interesting features of machine learning is that it lies on
the boundary of several different academic disciplines, principally computer
science, statistics, mathematics, and engineering. …machine learning is usually
studied as part of artificial intelligence, which puts it firmly into computer
science …understanding why these algorithms work requires a certain amount of
statistical and mathematical sophistication that is often missing from computer
science undergraduates." - Stephen Marsland @Marsland2009

Despite numerous concepts and perspectives on what machine learning entails, the
general objective remains consistent: Machine learning involves building models
that sufficiently resemble reality, are optimal with respect to a value function,
and can subsequently be utilized for predictions on new data.

## Why is machine learning important?

Machine learning facilitates solving problems that are difficult or impossible to
address deterministically @Jason2013. Variables may be missing or observed values
may contain embedded errors. Traditional models are often susceptible to being
under- or overdetermined. They may fail to generalize adequately or may be
excessively general. An appropriate machine learning model should provide an
approximate solution incorporating only relevant components.

## Classification of machine learning algorithms

In machine learning (ML), tasks are categorized based on how learning/feedback
($P$) is received and/or the type of problem they address. The following
categories can be distinguished:
