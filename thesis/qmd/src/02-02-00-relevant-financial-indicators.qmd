## Selected investment performance measures

Literature review does not explicitly mention performance metrics.
Nevertheless, the theoretical frameworks established by these scholars remain
valuable, as they constitute the foundation for numerous
measures. The widespread adoption of these indicators can be attributed to
 their accessibility and interpretability for typical investors (Marte, 2012).

Sharpe (1966) introduced the $\frac{R}{V}$ indicator, commonly known as the
Sharpe Ratio ($S$), expressed by the formula:
$$
S_i=\frac{E(R_i-R_F)}{\sigma_i}
$$
where:

* $R_i$ -- the $i$-th portfolio rate of return,
* $R_F$ -- risk-free rate
* $\sigma_i$ -- the standard deviation of the rate of return on the $i$-th
  portfolio.

Treynor (1965) proposed an alternative approach using $\beta_i$ instead of
$\sigma_i$ in the denominator. This formulation is expressed as:
$$
T_i=\frac{R_i-R_F}{\beta_i}
$$
where:

* $R_i$ -- the $i$-th portfolio rate of return,
* $R_F$ -- Risk-free rate
* $\beta_i$ -- Beta factor of the $i$-th portfolio.

Both $S$ and $T$ indicators are relative measures. Their values should be
compared against a benchmark to determine whether a portfolio is effectively
managed. Higher (lower) values indicate that the analyzed portfolios performed
better (worse) than the benchmark.


Jensen's alpha constitutes an absolute performance metric that quantifies the
differential between realized returns and those predicted by the Capital Asset
Pricing Model. Positive values signify outperformance relative to theoretical
expectations for the $i$-th portfolio.
This measure, which enjoys substantial credibility among professionals,
is mathematically defined as:

$$
\alpha_i=R_i-R_F-\beta_i(R_m-R_F)
$$
where:

* $R_i$ -- the $i$-th portfolio rate of return,
* $R_F$ -- Risk-free rate
* $\beta_i$ -- Beta factor of the $i$-th portfolio.


Drawdown measures the decline from a historical peak in an asset. The formula
is expressed as:

$$
D(T)=\max\{max_{0, t\in (0,T)} X(t)-X(\tau)\}
$$

The Sterling ratio (SR)

The maximum drawdown (MDD) at time $T$ represents the maximum Drawdown over
the asset's historical trajectory, expressed as:

$$
MDD(T)=\max_{\tau\in (0,T)}[\max_{t\in (0,\tau)} X(t)-X(\tau)]
$$
