### Statistical Arbitrage vs Other Types of Arbitrage

While statistical arbitrage relies on probabilistic relationships between
securities, several other arbitrage types exist in financial markets, each with
distinct characteristics:

#### Classical Arbitrage
Classical arbitrage involves simultaneously trading two or more fungible
instruments and converting between them to capture price differentials. At least
one leg might involve derivatives:

- **ETF arbitrage**: Buying an ETF while selling its constituent basket, then
  redeeming the ETF
- **ADR arbitrage**: Selling an ADR while buying its underlying foreign stock and
  currency, then creating the ADR
- **Futures arbitrage**: Buying a future while selling its underlying, holding
  both until expiration

#### Latency Arbitrage
Latency arbitrage leverages speed advantages to be first to complete trades
triggered by discrete events. Examples include racing to take stale bids/offers
on one exchange after observing trades on another, or using private fill prices
to trade ahead of other participants.

#### Time Arbitrage
Time arbitrage captures spreads between buyers and sellers demanding liquidity at
different periods. US equity wholesalers practice this by guaranteeing retail buy
orders, expecting offsetting sell orders to follow. Opportunities also arise when
linked instruments trade on exchanges with different operating hours.

#### Microstructure Arbitrage
This captures price dislocations using exchange-specific idiosyncrasies like
matching semantics, fee treatment, and specialized order types. Common
opportunities arise from non-continuous matching mechanisms such as opening/
closing auctions and their associated order types.

#### Statistical Arbitrage
Statistical arbitrage trades spreads between instruments based on probabilistic
estimations of convergence (mean reversion) or divergence (momentum). The
"dispersion trade" bets that index option prices should converge to weighted
baskets of options on the index's components. Unlike classical arbitrage,
statistical arbitrage involves probability-based relationships that may break
down, introducing additional risk elements.
