# Implementation of the Trading Agent
The following assumptions are established for the trading mechanisms and
algorithmic simulation framework:
(b) Zero latency exists between market data reception and trade execution when
   a favorable signal is present.
(a) The absence of market competition enables execution at counterparty prices
   (selling at bid price and purchasing at ask price).
(c) Position constraints limit holdings to x contract(s) at any given moment, with
   transactions restricted to whole contract units.
(d) A transaction fee of x% of the execution price is applied to all trades.

## Design of the research

The whole system can be divided into three main parts:

* Data preprocessing - taking FX data from Bloomberg with use of the dedicated API, parsing the data and adjusting
 it for the further analysis. The system is dedicated for currency trading, however with little adjustments
 it could fit in other asset classes as well.
 * Variable extraction - not all preprocessed currency pairs are relevant and worth adding. For instance,
 if $USD/CNH$ is highly correlated with $USD/CNY$ it is senseless to add the latter to the portfolio.
 #TO DO
* State-action space - the extracted variables, based on time series for currency pairs, are merged into state space




### Assumption

In the work, the author has assumed that:

* Zero slippage - the FX market is liquidity is good enough that there the execution price is equal to the price shown by the venue (Bloomberg)
* Zero market impact - trades executed by the agent are not big enough that they can move the market and cause significant market impact
