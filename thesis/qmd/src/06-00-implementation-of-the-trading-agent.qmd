# Implementation of the Trading Agent
The following assumptions are established for the trading mechanisms and
algorithmic simulation framework:
(b) Zero latency exists between market data reception and trade execution when
   a favorable signal is present.
(a) The absence of market competition enables execution at counterparty prices
   (selling at bid price and purchasing at ask price).
(c) Position constraints limit holdings to x contract(s) at any given moment, with
   transactions restricted to whole contract units.
(d) A transaction fee of x% of the execution price is applied to all trades.
