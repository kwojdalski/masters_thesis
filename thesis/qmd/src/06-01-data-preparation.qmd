| Field         | Description                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ts_recv       | The capture-server-received timestamp expressed as the number of  |
|               | nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch.                                 |
| size          | The order quantity.                                               |
| ts_event      | The matching-engine-received timestamp expressed as the number of |
|               | nanoseconds since the UNIX epoch.                                 |
| channel_id    | The channel ID assigned by Databento as an incrementing integer   |
|               | starting at zero.                                                 |
| rtype         | The record type. Each schema corresponds with a single rtype      |
|               | value.                                                            |

| flags         | A bit field indicating event end, message characteristics, and    |
|               | data quality.                                                     |
| instrument_id | The numeric instrument ID.                                        |
| ts_in_delta   | The matching-engine-sending timestamp expressed as the number of  |
|               | nanoseconds before ts_recv.                                       |
| action        | The event action. Can be Add, Cancel, Modify, cleaR book, Trade,  |
|               | Fill, or None.                                                    |
| sequence      | The message sequence number assigned at the venue.                |
| side          | The side that initiates the event. Can be Ask for a sell order    |
|               | (or sell aggressor in a trade), Bid for a buy order (or buy       |

| symbol        | The requested symbol for the instrument.                          |
| price         | The order price expressed as a signed integer where every 1 unit  |
|               | corresponds to 1e-9, i.e. 1/1,000,000,000 or 0.000000001.         |
