# Methodological Framework

The methodology consists of several key steps:

## Data Pre-processing

- Handling data cleaning, completion, and transformation
- Ensuring data quality and consistency
- Implementing appropriate data normalization techniques

## Cointegration Analysis

- Extracting linear combinations of time series with mean-reverting characteristics
- Using Johansen's test on a 1000-minute base timeframe
- Implementing ongoing monitoring across multiple time horizons
- Validating cointegration relationships

## Feature Extraction

- Building informative features from time series
- Including statistical, technical, and economic variables
- Developing features across different time horizons
- Implementing feature selection and dimensionality reduction techniques

## State-Action Space Construction

- Creating the agent's state space
- Defining action space boundaries
- Implementing state representation techniques
- Ensuring proper state-action mapping

## Trading Agents Implementation

- Developing agents that maximize financial performance metrics
- Implementing selected RL algorithms
- Creating robust training and testing frameworks
- Ensuring proper hyperparameter optimization

## Performance Evaluation

- Testing both trading agents with transaction costs included
- Comparing different approaches
- Analyzing resulting trading policies
- Implementing comprehensive performance metrics
