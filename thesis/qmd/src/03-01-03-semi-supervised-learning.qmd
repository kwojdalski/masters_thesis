# Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning represents a hybrid approach in machine learning where
the dataset contains both labeled and unlabeled examples. Formally, the
explanatory variables $X_i$ are available for all observations, but the labels
$Y_i$ are only available for a subset of the data. Typically, the quantity of
unlabeled examples significantly exceeds the number of labeled examples.

The primary objective, similar to supervised learning, is to discover the
relationship $Y = f(X)$. This is generally accomplished through a strategic
combination of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The underlying
principle involves labeled observations effectively "diffusing" their labels to
unlabeled observations that exhibit high similarity according to specific
criteria.

The appeal of semi-supervised learning lies in its ability to leverage large
amounts of unlabeled data, which is often more abundant and less costly to
obtain than labeled data. By incorporating these unlabeled examples, the
learning algorithm can potentially develop a more robust and generalizable model
than would be possible using only the limited labeled examples.

Several key techniques in semi-supervised learning include:

- **Self-training**: An iterative process where a model trained on labeled data
  makes predictions on unlabeled data, then adds high-confidence predictions to
  the training set.

- **Co-training**: Using multiple views or feature subsets to train separate
  models that teach each other by labeling unlabeled examples for one another.

- **Graph-based methods**: Constructing similarity graphs where nodes represent
  data points and edges represent similarities, allowing label propagation
  through the graph structure.

- **Generative models**: Using techniques like Gaussian Mixture Models to model
  the joint distribution of features and labels.

- **Semi-supervised SVMs (S3VMs)**: Extensions of Support Vector Machines that
  incorporate unlabeled data by seeking decision boundaries that avoid dense
  regions of unlabeled points.
