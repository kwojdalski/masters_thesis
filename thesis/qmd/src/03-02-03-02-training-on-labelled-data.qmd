#### Training a Trading System on Labeled Data

This methodology employs direct integration between the Trading System and
Input Series components. The system generates trading signals based on a
corpus of labeled trades (training dataset), while execution occurs in
response to market inputs (Input Series).

Formally, the system can be represented as:

$$f: X \rightarrow a$$

where:
- $X \in \mathbb{R}^n$ represents the input feature space
- $a \in A$ denotes the action space (buy, sell, hold)

The optimization objective can be expressed as:

$$\min_{\theta} \mathcal{L}(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \ell(f_{\theta}(X_i), a_i^*)$$

where:
- $\theta$ represents the model parameters
- $a_i^*$ denotes the labeled optimal action for input $X_i$
- $\ell$ is a loss function measuring deviation from labeled actions

The system's operational efficacy is contingent upon the Trading Module's
capacity to extract and utilize information from both Input Series and
Labeled Trades $\theta^{'}$. A fundamental limitation exists in this
approach: since optimization targets the Trading System rather than the
utility function $U(\theta, \theta^{'})$, the resultant solution typically
exhibits sub-optimal characteristics in terms of financial performance.
