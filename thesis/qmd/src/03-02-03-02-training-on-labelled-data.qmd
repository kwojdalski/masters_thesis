#### Training a Trading System on labeled Data

Such a trading system is based on the idea of direct integration between Trading
System and Input Series. Trades (signals) are based on labelled trades (training
set), and actual trades take place basing on input (Input Series).

Its efficiency and effectiveness rely on how well Trading Module can utilize
information from Input Series and Labeled Trades $\theta^{'}$. Since it's Trading
System, not utility function $U(\theta, \theta^{'})$ optimized, also in this case
the system tends to be sub-optimal.
