### Rule-Based Trading Strategies

A rule-based trading strategy uses explicit, human-defined rules for buying and
selling assets. These interpretable rules don't rely on forecasting models or
machine-generated predictions.

These strategies employ conditional logic where trading decisions follow
deterministic paths based on market conditions. Rules typically derive from
established market heuristics or technical analysis principles with proven
effectiveness.

The clear causal relationship between market conditions and trading actions
provides transparency, allowing traders to understand exactly why positions
change. Decisions respond to current market states rather than attempting to
predict future movements.

Rule-based systems apply consistently across all market conditions, eliminating
psychological biases and ensuring reproducible trading decisions. This
deterministic nature enables straightforward performance evaluation

The framework adapts to changing markets while maintaining its structure.
Parameter optimization enhances performance while preserving core logic,
allowing systematic evolution through iterative refinement.
