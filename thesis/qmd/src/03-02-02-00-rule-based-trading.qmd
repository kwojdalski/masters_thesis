### Rule-Based Trading Strategies

A rule-based strategy uses explicit, human-defined rules for buying and
trading. These are interpretable and do not rely on forecasting models or
machine-generated predictions but rather employ conditional logic
where trading decisions follow deterministic paths based on market conditions.
Typically, such rules derive from established market heuristics or technical analysis
principles with proven effectiveness.

The clear causal relationship between market conditions and trading actions
provides transparency, allowing traders to understand exactly why positions
change.

Rule-based systems apply consistently across all market conditions, eliminating
psychological biases and ensuring reproducible trading decisions. This
deterministic nature enables straightforward performance evaluation

The framework adapts to changing markets while maintaining its structure.
Parameter optimization enhances performance while preserving core logic,
allowing systematic evolution through iterative refinement.

#### Example: Cross-Venue Arbitrage Strategy

Strategy exploits temporary price discrepancies of the
same asset traded on different exchanges or venues.


The arbitrage opportunity can be formalized through the price differential:

$$D_t = P_{X,t} - P_{Y,t}$$

where:
- $P_X$ = price of asset on venue X
- $P_Y$ = price of asset on venue Y

In theoretically perfect market efficiency, this differential would
approach zero after accounting for all transaction costs, as arbitrage
opportunities would be immediately exploited by market participants.

The trading signal generation follows this decision rule:

$$\text{Signal} =
\begin{cases}
\text{BUY on Y, SELL on X}, & \text{if } D_t > \tau + c \\
\text{BUY on X, SELL on Y}, & \text{if } D_t < -\tau - c \\
\text{CLOSE POSITIONS}, & \text{if } |D_t| < \delta \\
\text{HOLD}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

where:
- $\tau$ represents the entry threshold
- $\delta$ represents the exit threshold
- $c$ accounts for transaction costs including fees and slippage

For instance, with `MSFT` stock listed on two electronic venues:
$$D_t = P_{\text{MSFT},\text{Venue1},t} - P_{\text{MSFT},\text{Venue2},t}$$

If the price differential exceeds 3 pips plus transaction costs ($\tau = 0.0003$),
the strategy signals to buy on the venue offering the lower price and
simultaneously sell on the venue with the higher price.

The optimization problem for this strategy can be expressed as:

$$\max_{\tau, \delta} \sum_{t=1}^{T} P_t(\tau, \delta) - TC_t$$

where:
- $P_t(\tau, \delta)$ represents the profit at time $t$ given thresholds
$\tau$ and $\delta$
- $TC_t$ represents the transaction costs
