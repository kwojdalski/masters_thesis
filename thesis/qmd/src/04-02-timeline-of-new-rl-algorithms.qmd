## Timeline of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

Reinforcement learning has evolved significantly over the decades, progressing
from theoretical foundations to sophisticated algorithms capable of algorithmic
trading problems. This section presents an overview of key developments in
RL, with particular attention to their applicability in
algorithmic trading.

It must be note

### 1950s–1980s: Theoretical Foundations
* 1952-1954: Bellman established Temporal Difference (TD) methodology and
  Markov Decision Process (MDP) formalism as mathematical foundations for RL.
* 1979: Watkins conceptualized Q-learning principles, though formal
  articulation came later.
* Financial application: Primarily theoretical, establishing frameworks for
  sequential investment decision-making.

### 1989-1992: Fundamental Algorithms
* 1989: Q-learning (Watkins)
  - Off-policy, model-free algorithm for determining state-action value
    functions.
  - Financial relevance: Suitable for discrete trading decisions.
  - Limitation: Poor scalability for extensive state/action spaces.
* 1992: SARSA
  - On-policy variant of Q-learning evaluating the implemented policy.
  - Financial relevance: More robust in non-stationary financial environments.

### Mid-1990s: Approximation Methods
* Implementation of function approximators for value function estimation.
* Financial application: Enabled management of larger state spaces approaching
  financial data complexity.

### 2013–2015: Deep Reinforcement Learning
* 2013 (DeepMind): Integration of Q-learning with deep neural networks.
  - Experience replay and target networks enhanced learning stability.
* 2015: DQN achieved human-comparable performance in Atari environments.
  - Financial implementation: First significant market applications using
    neural networks for feature extraction from financial data.

### 2015–2016: Policy Gradient Methodologies
* REINFORCE (Williams, 1992): Initial stochastic policy gradient formulation.
* Actor-Critic: Separated policy representation from value function estimation.
  - Financial advantage: Direct return optimization and accommodation of
    continuous action spaces for position sizing.

### 2016–2018: Advanced Algorithmic Frameworks
* A3C (2016): Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic
  - Parallel learning across multiple agents for greater efficiency.
* DDPG (2015): Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient
  - Specialized for deterministic continuous policy learning.
* PPO (2017): Proximal Policy Optimization
  - Conservative policy updates with improved reliability.
* SAC (2018): Soft Actor-Critic
  - Off-policy approach with entropy maximization for exploration-exploitation
    balance.
* Financial applications: Execution optimization, portfolio construction, and
  market-making strategies.

### 2018–Present: Multi-Agent Systems and Meta-Learning
* Multi-Agent RL: Models market participant interactions for realistic impact
  simulation.
* Meta-RL: Develops systems capable of rapid adaptation to new market regimes.

### 2020s Onwards: Practical Implementation
* Hierarchical RL: Integrates strategic planning with tactical execution.
* Safe RL: Implements safeguards against catastrophic market losses.
* Explainable RL: Enhances decision transparency for regulatory compliance.
* Current priorities: Sample efficiency, risk-sensitive objectives, and
  regulatory constraint integration.
