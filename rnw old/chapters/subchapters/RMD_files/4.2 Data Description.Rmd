Finance has been highly influenced 
 The problem to be considered in my master’s thesis is from the area between finance and computer sciences. There are different approaches to allocating capital in financial markets. Some of them are old-fashioned (but can be still good, e.g. investing in fundamentally underpriced equities), but I think that there is space for more modern ways of investing, more quantitative-driven. One of these is artificial-intelligence-aided investing. This is the approach in which an investor has less-to-none decisions to take as to what and when to buy or sell. I would like to check whether implementing certain algorithms can be fruitful for investors in terms of risk and reward (return). Why had artificial intelligence? I believe that, as it is a hot topic in the US right now, by which I mean it is started to get utilized by financial institutions (e.g. mostly hedge funds), implications of delivering very good and consistent code can help in a so-called seeking alpha. My general, unrelated to hypotheses, opinion is that technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Of course, there are successful traders who exploit certain models but I believe that they are just faster in spotting price/volume patterns. Obviously, if we take into account the number of traders, it may turn out that it is very costly to employ people who cannot even deliver persistent results (if some traders are better, then some of them must be worse). Then artificial intelligence comes. It is almost cost-free because a computer does everything instead of an employee. Moreover, it can spot, if well-designed, any pattern instantly, in a fraction of a second, so even this fact may affect positively on generated results. In other words, algorithms can get ahead of technical analysts who have to, at least partially, execute orders manually. Moreover, they are 100% disciplined. Therefore, there is much less risk of disobedience from a set of trading rules. It is needed to mention that, as Barber and Odean (2001)  spotted, men are worse in investing than women because they trade too much and are overconfident. Algorithms are also ahead of this because, and it comes as no surprise, they do not have emotions.
The above-stated arguments are just a beginning because there are at least few more which I wish to outline in my master’s thesis, and which helps in formulate the very general hypothesis that algorithms, specifically with the use of the AI field, can outperform financial analysts.
Data
From the perspective of a good master’s thesis, data is crucial. That is why I tried to make sure that my data is widely available. My master’s thesis will rely on few datasets taken from the following sources:
	Yahoo! Finance,
	Google Finance,
	Bloomberg;
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
